Are you a Linux user looking to install the Nextcloud All-in-One, or AIO, Docker
image? In this blog, we walk you through the steps, just like we did in our last
AIO Guide for Windows 10 & 11[1]! [image 1: üéâ (link #2)]
 
Nextcloud All-in-One is a Docker-based project which allows to install just one 
container that does the heavy lifting of creating and managing all containers 
needed for a full-blown Nextcloud installation. Nextcloud AIO not only provides 
easy deployment and maintenance of many Nextcloud features included, but you can
also expect a user friendly interface, stress-free updates and a more simplistic
approach for getting most features to work out-of-the-box.
 
Nextcloud AIO includes:
 
  * Nextcloud
  * Nextcloud Office
  * High performance backend for Nextcloud Files
  * High performance backend for Nextcloud Talk
  * Backup solution (based on BorgBackup[3])
  * Imaginary (for previews of heic, tiff and webp)
  * ClamAV (Antivirus backend for Nextcloud)
  * Fulltextsearch
 
 
  ‚ÄúWith using Nextcloud All-in-One compared to the other installation methods, I
  found the performance is substantially better, especially on an office 
  server.‚Äù

Read on for a clear and easy to follow step-by-step guide for how to set up an 
AIO for a Linux PC sucessfully.
 
Guide for AIO on Linux
 
The following instructions are valid for a Linux PC (e.g. with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
with a x64 CPU with at least 4GB of RAM and 2 cores.
 
You will need to obtain a public domain and be able to open ports for the guide 
to work properly. Make sure that you are not behind CGNAT as it will not work 
with that either.
 
In addition, please note that the instructions are for a setup without web 
server or reverse proxy (like Apache, Nginx, etc.) already being in place. If 
you want to run it behind a web server or reverse proxy, refer here[4].
 
Install Docker
 
 1. Install Docker on your Linux installation by following the official 
 documentation[5]. The easiest way is installing it by using the convenience 
 script:
 
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sudo sh
 
2. If you need Ipv6 support, you should enable it by following the guide 
here[6].
 
Install AIO
 
3. Now, open the Terminal and start AIO with this command:
# For x64 CPUs and without a web server or reverse proxy (like Apache, Nginx and else) already in place:
sudo docker run \
--sig-proxy=false \
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \
--restart always \
--publish 80:80 \
--publish 8080:8080 \
--publish 8443:8443 \
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
 
Note: You may be interested in adjusting Nextcloud‚Äôs datadir to store the files 
in a different location than the default docker volume. See this 
documentation[7] on how to do it.
 
4. Next, you can open the AIO interface on https://localhost:8080 or 
https://the.servers.ip.address:8080. You need to accept the self-signed 
certificate, afterwards you should see this:
[image 2: Nextcloud AIO setup screen (link #8)][8] 
 
Alternatively, if port 80 and 8443 should be opened in your firewall/router and 
a domain is configured to point to your server, you can reach the AIO interface 
with a valid certificate using https://your-domain.com:8443.
 
5. Click on ‚ÄòOpen Nextcloud AIO login‚Äô and paste in your password:
[image 3: Nextcloud AIO login screen (link #9)][9] 
 
6. Then, you should see the AIO interface:
[image 4: Nextcloud AIO interface screen (link #10)][10] 
 
7. Next, type in your public domain that you you‚Äôve got before doing this guide.
The interface should help you figuring out which are the exact steps. (Set up 
DDNS for your domain to point to your public IP, port-forward at least ports 
443/tcp, 3478/udp and 3478/tcp to your Linux machine.
 
8. After you‚Äôve set it up correctly, it should allow you to pass to the next 
step where you can configure wanted optional add-ons and the timezone and click 
on Start containers in order to download and start them.

9. At this point, you should see a spinner that will take a while depending on 
your internet speed ~ around 10min or more.

10. When all containers are downloaded and started, you will see this screen 
which shows the containers still starting which will do the first installation 
for you:

11. When everything is done, you should see this screen:
[image 8: Nextcloud AIO screen showing that the setup is complete (link 
#14)][14] 
 
12. Finally you can now open your new Nextcloud instance and log in with the 
given admin credentials.
 
That‚Äôs it! Everything is set and ready for production! [image 9: ‚ú® (link #15)]
