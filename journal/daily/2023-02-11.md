- 00:03 Starting Notes
- 01:20 OK this zertl app on android is cool looking
- 02:09 time for bed
- 02:39 dogs watered, house locked up and I'm  unloading lunch. Playing with a new app zettel that seems to match up with zk and nvim.  On the nvim front.  My config is weak but key map is hot so  I wonder if lunar would be better replacing the entire key map or at least which-key
- 12:05 I ame auite tired from not sleeping and nana is still a lump on the couch almost 3 weeks after the stent inserted.
